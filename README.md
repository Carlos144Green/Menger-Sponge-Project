# Menger-Sponge-Project

In this project I built a WebGL program that shows a procedurally-generated fractals, the Menger sponge, with full user interaction using mouse and keyboard camera controls. I also applied texturing by writing several simple shaders that draw a checkerboard pattern on an infinite ground plane using 4 triangles.
